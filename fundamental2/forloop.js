// Control Structures: for loop
// it help is to perform a task over and over again

// suppose we buy 5 clothes so we have to go market 5 times.

// console.log('buy 1 cloth');
// console.log('buy 2 cloth');
// console.log('buy 3 cloth');
// console.log('buy 4 cloth');
// console.log('buy 5 cloth');
 
// so for big data we have to write like this again and again
// but loop can solve this problem it do a work again and again
// until we tell it to stop it 

// for(initial value(rep); condition; increament/decreament)

// for loop keeps while condition is true
for (let rep = 1; rep <= 10; rep++)
{
    // console.log('buy'+ rep + 'cloth');
  console.log(`buy ${rep} cloth`);
}
