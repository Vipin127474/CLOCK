                   // DATA TRANSFORMATION: MAP, FILTER, REDUCE
// THESE ARE METHODS OF ARRAY

// MAP

IT IS SIMILAR TO FOREACH LOOP BUT WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT 
MAP CREATES A BRAND NEW ARRAY BASED ON THE ORIGINAL ARRAY 

map method takes an array, and loop over that array and in each iteration
, it applies a callback function that specify in our to the current 
array element 

in this each element of an array multiplied by 2 and puts into a new 
array

we can say that it Maps the values of the original array to a new array
that is why we call it map

map returns a new array containing the results of applying an operation
on all original array element


//FILTER

it is used to filter for elements in the original array which satisfy 
a certain condition.

in this we looking for elements greater than 2.
filter returns a new array containing the array elements that passed
a specified condition. all other elements which are not passed will get
filtered out from an array


// REDUCE

reduce boils("REDUCE") all array elements down to one single value 

// like sum of all elements in an array
